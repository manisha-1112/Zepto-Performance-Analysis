# Zepto Product Performance Analysis

**Product Performance Analysis – Zepto**  
*Unlocking growth through customer insights and product strategy (2022–2024).*

---

## Overview
This repository contains a data-driven product case study for Zepto. The analysis focuses on city-wise Average Order Value (AOV), category-level performance, and customer satisfaction. Based on the findings, the project proposes product and marketing interventions (localized promotions, smart bundling, supplier quality improvements, and a feedback loop) and demonstrates UI solutions via Figma mockups.

---

## Key Objectives
- Analyze city-wise demand and AOV to identify high-potential but underperforming metros.  
- Evaluate product category health to spot revenue drivers and AOV draggers.  
- Quantify customer satisfaction using review scores to identify quality issues.  
- Propose actionable product & marketing recommendations to improve AOV, retention, and NPS.

---

## Highlights / Executive Summary
- **City Performance:** Bangalore (highest AOV) and Kolkata outperform the overall average; Mumbai & Chennai underperform despite large user bases.  
- **Category Spend:** Electronics and Dairy drive the highest AOV; Beverages and Fast Food have the lowest AOV.  
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Vegetables, Fast Food, and Groceries receive high reviews; Beverages and Dairy show low ratings indicating potential quality issues.  
- **Opportunities:** Localized promotions for low-AOV metros, smart bundling to lift basket size, supplier quality program, and a one-tap feedback loop to quickly surface issues.

## Quick insights 
- Bangalore: AOV ≈ ₹374 (top) — strong product-market fit.  
- Mumbai & Chennai: AOV < ₹350 — target cities for localized offers.  
- Electronics & Dairy: High AOV (₹400+).  
- Beverages & Dairy: Low review scores — prioritize supplier QA.  
- Recommended actions: localized promos, smart bundles, supplier quality program, one-tap feedback.

## Proposed experiments & KPIs
**Phase 1 (1–3 months)**
- A/B test localized promotions in Mumbai & Chennai.  
- Pilot 3 bundle combos (Dairy+Bakery, Beverages+Snacks, Fruits+Dairy).  
**KPIs:** % lift in AOV, repeat order rate, % change in category review scores.

**Phase 2 (3–6 months)**
- Expand successful bundles and promotions.  
- Implement supplier QA for flagged categories.  
**KPIs:** AOV, NPS, monthly active users (MAU), churn rate.
